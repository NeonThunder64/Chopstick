# Chopstick
An android apk puller for Waydroid on Ubuntu Touch

Chopstick is a native rss apk puller (forked from ilkakooo0's version of podbird "podphoenix") for Waydroid on Ubuntu Touch. This app will pull apk downloads from F-droid and github and then with adb shell install
the those apks on your device. I wanted to create this app so I wouldn't have to open the android interface or termial when I want to install an apk to waydroid.

Please note this idea is in alpha and may or may not be possible with UT's app sandbox security implentation at time of writing.
